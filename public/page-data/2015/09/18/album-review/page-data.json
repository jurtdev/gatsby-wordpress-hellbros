Big, brash, raw and in your face, I recommend you stop what you are doing and go and get yourself a copy right away (OK, finish reading this first).</p>\n<p>Melodic, yet heavy this well written style of rock is not easy to pigeon hole – good, us Brits are far too quick off the mark when it comes to that- but if you head somewhere in the region of a slightly heavier Los Bastardos Finlandeses then you will not be too far off.</p>\n<p>The band are comprised of brothers Peter and Christian Jurt on vocals/guitar and guitar respectively, alongside their childhood friends Josh Roy on drums and Mat Colins on bass and having grown up together makes them one of those rare bands that really can create something special having been around each other so long.</p>\n<p>“Hellbros” features 11 tracks in the space of 36 minutes, each one as good as the last and with pounding drums and a rhythm section that is nothing short of bombastic. With some big solid riffs, the guitar work at times has a feel of Iron Maiden to it, “For The Worst” being the best example of this, as well as being my favourite track on the album. “Shoot The Horse” has echoes of the best of current Scandinavian rock bands whilst “Trespassing By Night” contains the best guitar solo on the album.</p>\n<p>Frontman Peter Jurt’s vocals are consistently strong throughout but just listen to “Dead City Rockers” for an example of how Hellbros have cross genre appeal. The likes of “Tombstone”, “Kill You” and “I Heart Drugs” bounce along nicely, whilst opening track “Street Party” is a statement of intent that makes me want to see what the band can do live. *****</p>\n<p>Review by Nikk Gunns</p>\n","uri":"/2015/09/18/album-review/","author":{"name":"Christian Jurt","nickname":null,"slug":"christian"},"categories":{"nodes":[{"slug":"uncategorized","name":"Uncategorized"}]},"tags":{"nodes":[]},"comments":{"nodes":[{"date":"2015-12-12 09:04:34","id":"Y29tbWVudDoyMA==","author":{"__typename":"WPGraphql_CommentAuthor","id":"Y29tbWVudF9hdXRob3I6MjA=","email":"4l508pvlr@outlook.com","name":"Rohit","url":"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100003469766968"},"commentId":20,"content":"<p>&#8211; these are awesome!
